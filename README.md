# Big Data Analytics Project
**Confirmed Positive Cases of COVID-19 in Ontario**

# Project Stages

**1-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** This stage involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data to prepare it for analysis.

**2-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** analyze the data distributions, look at correlations, and visualize key patterns to get a better understanding of the dataset.

**3-Model Selection and Training:** In this stage, choosing the appropriate machine learning models and train them on our dataset.

**4-Model Evaluation and Comparison:** evaluate the performance of the models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, and then compare the results to select the best model.

**5-Conclusions and Future Work:** Finally, summarize the findings, draw conclusions, and suggest possible directions for future work.
